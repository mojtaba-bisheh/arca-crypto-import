#   caliptra-rtl                          Tessera
#   src/sha512/rtl/sha512.sv          ->  src/sha512/rtl/tessera_sha512.sv
#   src/sha512/coverage/...           ->  src/sha512/coverage/...
#   src/sha512/tb|stimulus|uvmf_...   ->  same path, upstream names kept
#   src/sha512/config/sha512_ctrl.vf  ->  src/sha512/config/tessera_sha512_ctrl.vf (generated)
#
# Block-specific notes
# --------------------
# * The core is split across .v and .sv: sha512_core.v, sha512_w_mem.v and the
#   constant ROMs are Verilog-2001. The rename engine keys off file *extension*
#   for the HDL set, so .v is prefixed and rewritten exactly like .sv.
# * sha512_masked is NOT imported here. It is its own upstream directory and its
#   own Tessera block (rename_sha512_masked.sh), which in turn references the four
#   identifiers this block declares and it consumes. Keeping the ownership split
#   the same as upstream is what lets either side be bumped independently.
# * sha512_reg_uvm.sv and sha512_reg.rdl are excluded: both are regenerated from
#   the register spec, so vendoring them would commit derived state.
# * coverage/ is delivery tier but not synthesizable -- it is functional-coverage
#   bind code -- so its file names are kept and only its references are rewritten.
