# ------
#   caliptra-rtl                          Tessera
#   src/sha256/rtl/sha256.sv          ->  src/sha256/rtl/tessera_sha256.sv
#   src/sha256/coverage/...           ->  src/sha256/coverage/...
#   src/sha256/tb|stimulus            ->  same path, upstream names kept
#   src/sha256/config/sha256_ctrl.vf  ->  src/sha256/config/tessera_sha256_ctrl.vf (generated)
#
# Block-specific notes
# --------------------
# * sha256_param.sv is `include-d rather than compiled as its own unit. It is a
#   block-private header living in rtl/, so it is renamed with the rest of the
#   synthesized set and the `include that names it is rewritten to match -- that
#   is rc_fix_file_references, not the identifier pass.
# * No UVMF bench upstream: the SHA-256 environment is the directed tb/ plus
#   stimulus/, both imported as collateral.
# * sha256_reg_uvm.sv and sha256_reg.rdl are excluded as regenerated artifacts.
# * Upstream also ships sha256_random_test.vf; like every other .vf it is not
#   imported, since Tessera generates its own filelist. Only sha256_ctrl.vf is read,
#   and only to recover upstream's compile order.
