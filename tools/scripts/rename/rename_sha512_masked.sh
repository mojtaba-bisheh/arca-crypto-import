# Block-specific notes
# --------------------
# * This is the side-channel-hardened SHA-512 datapath. It is a *dependency of
#   HMAC*, not a standalone engine: hmac_core instantiates sha512_masked_core.
#   It is imported as its own block because upstream keeps it as its own
#   top-level directory, and because masking is the kind of thing you want to
#   be able to bump independently of the HMAC wrapper around it.
# * It is the only block in this import with no register file: no .rdl, no
#   _reg_uvm.sv, no coverage/ and no global `includes.
# * It reaches into the *unmasked* sha512 block for the round constants and the
#   message schedule (sha512_h_constants, sha512_k_constants, sha512_w_mem) and
#   for sha512_core. Those are declared by the sha512 import, so they are listed
#   here as cross-block identifiers: this block must rewrite its references to
#   them even though it does not own them.
