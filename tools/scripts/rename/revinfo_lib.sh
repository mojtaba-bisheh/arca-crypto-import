# Shared lookup for the per-block provenance records.
#
# Each vendored block carries its own revinfo *inside* the block directory:
#
#   src/ecc/revinfo.yml    provenance: upstream commit, subtrees, policy, manifest
#   src/ecc/revinfo.map    identifier rename map
#
# so that copying src/ecc/ anywhere carries the record of where it came from.
# The block name is read from the file rather than inferred from the directory,
# because a block may be vendored to a different path than it has upstream
# (BLOCK_DIR) and may own more than one directory (hmac owns hmac_drbg too).
#
# Source this, then use ri_find / ri_path.

# ri_find <dest> -- print "<block> <path-to-revinfo.yml>" per imported block.
