#
# Block-specific notes
# --------------------
# * This block does not exist on `main`. It lives on caliptra-rtl's `future`
#   branch, so the import must be run with `--branch future` -- the branch is
#   *declared*, not read from the checkout, because CI re-imports from a
#   detached HEAD. The recorded commit is what pins the content; the branch is
#   what tells you which changelog to read when pulling an update.
#
# * hmac256 instantiates `sha256_masked_core`, which lives in src/sha256_masked/
#   -- now its own ARCA block (rename_sha256_masked.sh), so the identifier is
#   declared as arca_sha256_masked_core and this import has to rewrite its
#   reference to match. That is what the EXTRA_RENAME_IDENTS entry below does.
#   Leaving it out is the failure mode worth naming: hmac256 would instantiate
#   the upstream module while ARCA declares the prefixed one, and that is
#   invisible to the generated filelist, which resolves cross-block names
#   against ${CALIPTRA_ROOT} rather than against the vendored tree.
#   sha256_masked is on `future` too, so the two blocks move together.
#
# * hmac256 also sits on top of src/sha256/, which ARCA *does* vendor -- but it
#   names no identifier from it (only sha256_masked_core), so there is nothing
#   to add to the map. Verified by grepping the rtl/ sources rather than
#   assumed from the .vf, which lists sha256 sources purely as compile order.
#
# * Unlike hmac (512), hmac256 reads no environment-supplied configuration
#   macro: hmac256_param_pkg hard-codes its widths rather than deriving them
#   from CLP_CSR_* in caliptra_macros.svh. ENV_MACRO_SPECS is empty for that
#   reason, not by oversight.
#
# * hmac256_reg_uvm.sv and hmac256_reg.rdl are excluded as regenerated
#   artifacts; hmac256_reg_covergroups.svh / _reg_sample.svh are `include-d by
#   the register block and are renamed with it.
