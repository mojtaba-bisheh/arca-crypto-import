# Layout
# ------
#   caliptra-rtl                        Tessera
#   src/sha3/rtl/sha3.sv            ->  src/sha3/rtl/tessera_sha3.sv
#   src/sha3/config/sha3_ctrl.vf    ->  src/sha3/config/tessera_sha3_ctrl.vf (generated)
#
# Block-specific notes
# --------------------
# * This block is rtl/ and config/ only -- no tb/, no coverage/, no UVMF. Upstream
#   verifies SHA-3 through the KMAC block that wraps it, which is out of scope
#   here. So the import has a delivery tier and no collateral tier at all, which
#   is a useful shape to have in the demo: it shows the collateral tier is
#   genuinely optional rather than assumed.
# * rtl/ carries kmac_reg.rdl as well as sha3_reg.rdl. Both are excluded along
#   with sha3_reg_uvm.sv -- all three are register-spec input or output, not
#   source. Note the kmac .rdl sitting in sha3/rtl/ is an upstream layout quirk;
#   it is excluded by the same glob rather than by a special case.
# * The Keccak round logic is heavily macro- and generate-driven. The identifier
#   pass uses SystemVerilog boundaries rather than \b, which matters here because
#   names like sha3pad and sha3_pkg share a prefix with sha3 itself.
