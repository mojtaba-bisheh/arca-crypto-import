#
# For every imported file this strips the Tessera prefix back off and diffs the
# result against the exact upstream blob recorded in the block's revinfo.yml.
# A clean run means the vendored RTL differs from caliptra-rtl by nothing but
# names -- no accidental logic edits, no dropped lines, no mangled strings.
#
# The set of files proved is the *committed tree*, enumerated over the subtrees
# the block declared, rather than a recorded file list. That way every committed
# file has to justify itself by mapping back to a real upstream blob; a file
# added locally cannot escape the proof just by not being on a list. Only the
# files the import declares it generated (artifacts.generated -- the compile
# -order filelist and the captured environment-macro header) are exempt, and
# those are held to bit-identical regeneration by CI instead.
#
# The complementary direction -- an upstream file that was never imported --
# is covered by the re-import job, which regenerates every block and fails on
# any file that comes back changed or uncommitted.
#
# The only differences tolerated are `include redirections, which the import
# performs on purpose when it captures environment configuration macros into a
# block-private header.
#
# "Stripping the prefix" is not quite the whole inverse. A block may also carry
# a *stem* rewrite (src/hmac -> src/hmac512, hmac_core -> hmac512_core), which
# this has to undo as well or every file in that block reads as a difference.
# The policy is read back out of the block's own revinfo.yml rather than
# hard-coded, so the check stays an inverse of whatever the import declared.
