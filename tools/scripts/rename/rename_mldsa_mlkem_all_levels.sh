#
# The Tessera directory is named for what the engine implements rather than for
# its upstream codename: upstream calls it "abr" (Adams Bridge), which says
# nothing about ML-DSA, ML-KEM, or the security levels it covers.
#
# The directory name and the identifier stem are deliberately different knobs.
# The directory is mldsa_mlkem_all_levels; the identifiers keep the short
# upstream abr_ stem, so modules stay tessera_abr_top rather than growing a
# 22-character prefix across all 222 of them. See the stem policy in
# rename_common.sh for the case where the two are tied together instead.
#
# The one block that is not a caliptra-rtl directory
# --------------------------------------------------
# Every other engine here lives entirely inside caliptra-rtl. ABR does not. In
# caliptra-rtl, src/abr/ holds four files -- a compile spec and a coverage bind --
# and the ~160 RTL files live in a separate repository, chipsalliance/adams-bridge,
# wired in as the git submodule submodules/adams-bridge.
#
# Tessera does not carry that split: the engineering decision was to keep ABR as a
# normal src/<block>/ tree like every other engine. So this driver flattens two
# repositories into one Tessera block:
#
#   caliptra-rtl    src/abr/coverage/        -> src/mldsa_mlkem_all_levels/coverage/
#   adams-bridge    src/<unit>/rtl/          -> src/mldsa_mlkem_all_levels/<unit>/rtl/
#   adams-bridge    src/abr_top/coverage/    -> src/mldsa_mlkem_all_levels/abr_top/coverage/
#
# That flattening costs us something real, and the cost is paid in revinfo.
# Every other block's provenance is one commit. ABR's is two, and the second one
# is the one that actually matters -- caliptra-rtl's submodule pointer can sit
# still for months while adams-bridge moves. SUBMODULE_PATHS makes the engine
# record the adams-bridge HEAD as its own provenance entry, so
#
#   git -C <adams-bridge> log --oneline <recorded sha>..origin/main
#
# answers "what changed since we vendored this" for the sources we actually
# shipped, not for the pointer to them.
#
# Why the unit directories survive the flattening
# -----------------------------------------------
# adams-bridge is 25 units, each with its own rtl/. They could have been poured
# into one src/mldsa_mlkem_all_levels/rtl/, and that would have been simpler. They are not, because
# the per-unit `include directories are load-bearing: abr_top.vf carries 26
# +incdir+ lines, one per unit, and the sources `include across unit boundaries
# by bare filename. Collapsing the tree would silently change which file an
# `include resolves to. Keeping the hierarchy means the generated filelist's
# +incdir+ set is a mechanical translation of upstream's.
#
# Other block-specific notes
# --------------------------
# * Compile order comes from adams-bridge's own abr_top.vf. Its paths are
#   ${ADAMSBRIDGE_ROOT}-rooted rather than ${CALIPTRA_ROOT}-rooted, which costs
#   nothing: rc_emit_filelist matches on basenames, not on path prefixes.
# * The submodule sits *inside* the caliptra-rtl checkout, so every path here is
#   still an ordinary $UPSTREAM-relative path and no new staging machinery is
#   needed -- only the provenance record had to learn about it.
# * abr_prim/lint/ is skipped, like aes/lint/ and hmac's rtl_lint waiver: tool
#   configuration, not source.
# * No EXTRA_RENAME_IDENTS. ABR vendors its own copies of the primitives
#   (abr_prim, abr_prim_generic) and its own Keccak (abr_sha3) rather than
#   sharing caliptra-rtl's, so it has no cross-block references to rewrite --
#   it is the only leaf in the dependency matrix.
