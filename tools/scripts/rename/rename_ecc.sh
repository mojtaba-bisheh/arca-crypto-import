#
# Layout
# ------
# The Tessera tree mirrors the caliptra-rtl hierarchy, so the correspondence
# between the two trees is 1:1:
#
#   caliptra-rtl                          Tessera
#   src/ecc/rtl/ecc_top.sv            ->  src/ecc/rtl/tessera_ecc_top.sv
#   src/ecc/coverage/ecc_top_cov_if.sv -> src/ecc/coverage/tessera_ecc_top_cov_if.sv
#   src/ecc/config/ecc_top.vf         ->  src/ecc/config/tessera_ecc_top.vf (generated)
#   src/ecc/tb/ecc_top_tb.sv          ->  src/ecc/tb/tessera_ecc_top_tb.sv
#   src/ecc/stimulus/...              ->  src/ecc/stimulus/...
#   src/ecc/uvmf_ecc/...              ->  src/ecc/uvmf_ecc/...
#
# The whole src/ecc folder is imported. rtl/ + coverage/ are the *delivery*
# (strict contract, elaborated in CI); tb/, stimulus/ and uvmf_ecc/ are
# *collateral* (same identifier map, looser contract) -- see the "Two tiers"
# section in rename_common.sh.
#
# src/ecc/formal/ is deliberately not imported: the formal properties are a
# caliptra-rtl verification asset, not part of the deliverable, and Tessera has no
# formal flow to run them in. Vendoring them would mean maintaining 42 files of
# bound properties through every upstream bump for no benefit.
#
# Block-specific notes
# --------------------
# * ECC lives in a single upstream directory (src/ecc/rtl) but instantiates
#   `hmac_drbg`, which lives in src/hmac_drbg/rtl and is owned by the HMAC
#   import. Ownership policy: hmac_drbg is imported exactly once, by
#   rename_hmac512.sh. ECC only rewrites the *reference* so both imports link
#   against the same `<prefix>hmac_drbg` module. See EXTRA_RENAME_IDENTS.
# * Those two cross-block names are renamed under *different* policies, and
#   neither policy is stated here. hmac_param_pkg belongs to the SHA-512 HMAC
#   engine, which Tessera shelves as hmac512, so it becomes tessera_hmac512_param_pkg;
#   hmac_drbg is on the stem keep list and stays tessera_hmac_drbg. Both follow
#   from the repo-wide stem policy in rename_common.sh, which is exactly why
#   that policy is declared there and not in rename_hmac512.sh -- two drivers
#   holding two copies of the same naming decision is how they drift apart.
# * ECC guards its packages with hand-written include guards whose names do not
#   follow one pattern (CALIPTRA_ECC_DEFINES, CALIPTRA_ECC_PARAMS_PKG,
#   CALIPTRA_ECC_PM_UOP_PKG, ECC_DSA_UOP_PKG). They are discovered from the
#   sources rather than hard-coded.
# * ecc_reg_uvm.sv is a UVM register model that `includes generated covergroup
#   headers which are not part of the RTL delivery; it is excluded.
# * ecc_reg.rdl is the upstream register description. It is excluded from the
#   renamed fileset because regenerating from it would produce unprefixed RTL;
#   if Tessera ever needs to regenerate, re-run this script afterwards.
# * The coverage/ directory is imported too. It exercises a case the rtl/
#   directories do not: `bind ecc_top ecc_top_cov_if ...` -- the rename engine
#   has to rewrite the bind target as well as the interface name.
# * coverage/config/ecc_cm_hier.cfg IS imported now that the testbench comes
#   along; the hierarchy path it names (ecc_top_tb.dut) is renamed with
#   everything else.
# * src/ecc/config/ is deliberately NOT collateral. Tessera generates its own
#   filelist there, and the upstream ecc_top.vf / ecc_top_tb.vf / compile.yml
#   resolve $COMPILE_ROOT against the caliptra-rtl build environment. Copying
#   them would both collide with the generated tessera_ecc_top.vf and re-introduce
#   a dependency on an upstream build system.
# * src/ecc/tb/ecc_secp384r1.exe and the three uvmf .ucdb coverage databases are
#   build/simulation *outputs* checked into upstream. They are skipped by
#   ARTIFACT_GLOBS -- vendoring them would commit stale results.
# * ECC needs no environment configuration macros.
